⚔️ Halt, wanderer of distant lands. ⚔️

I am <b>Perceval</b>, guardian of Camelot's sacred relics. Before you stand the gleaming spires of Camelot, where alabaster towers reach toward heaven and golden banners flutter in the eternal breeze. These hallowed halls have witnessed the greatest feats of chivalry known to mankind.

Tell me, traveler - what drives your quest to enter these majestic walls?`;

"Treasure? YOURS by RIGHT?! How dare you approach these sacred halls with such greed in your heart! These treasures belong to Arthur and the righteous Knights who earned them through blood and honor - not to fortune hunters with sticky fingers and empty hearts!

There is nothing for your kind here. Back to whatever distant land spawned you, before I show you firsthand how we deal with thieves at Camelot! Be gone, and count yourself fortunate I let you leave with your life intact!"

Thy interest in our ancient wisdom speaks well of thy character, traveler.

✨ The Round Table's legacy lives on through those who honor its virtues.

👑 King Arthur has established trials for those who wish to prove their worth. Present thy quests of honor, and I shall judge if thy heart is pure enough to claim the treasure that awaits the truly worthy.

The path of chivalry is not for the faint of heart, yet the rewards for those who walk it with honor are beyond measure.
